Originally hailing from the American Midwest, I passed through the Pacific Northwest for a few years en route to my current home in one of the Far East's biggest and busiest cities.<br/><br/>By day (and often by night), I'm a versatile developer, at one point or another having written code at nearly every level of the stack. My specialties lie in the realm of systems-level code, but I also enjoy architecting, developing, and maintaining robust API platforms.<br/><br/>In general, I'm passionate about tackling challenging, fundamental problems with code that is fast, efficient, and organized.<br/><br/>When I'm not working, you'll probably find me pursuing one of the hobbies I've accumulated along the way: running, Ultimate, drinking coffee, and/or brushing up on my Chinese.
